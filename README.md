# `import { pain } from 'react'`

> A cursed-but-useful React + Vite + Tailwind starter. Built for speed, suffering, and spontaneous creativity. Handle with care.

---

## What is this?
This is a lightweight boilerplate for building React apps with Vite and Tailwind — but themed for the frontend dev who enjoys a little existential dread while coding.
It comes opinionated with modern versions of React, Tailwind v4, React Router, and ESLint so you can *start building immediately* — and complain loudly if something breaks.

---

## Features
- ✅ Vite-powered fast dev server (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ React 19-ready
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 integration (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
- ✅ React Router pre-installed
- ✅ ESLint config for cleaner suffering
- ✅ Minimal, centered layout demo (no fluff, just vibes)
- ✅ `data-scroll-container` retained for your scroll-to-top hacks

## Quickstart

```bash
# clone
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/import--pain-from-react.git
cd import--pain-from-react

# install
npm install

# dev
npm run dev

# build
npm run build

# lint
npm run lint
````

## Project structure (starter)

```
src/
 ├─ components/
 ├─ pages/
 ├─ App.jsx
 ├─ main.jsx
 └─ index.css
```

---

## Usage notes

* The repo intentionally keeps `data-scroll-container` in the top-level wrapper to avoid React scroll-to-top bugs — you’re welcome.
* Replace the demo sections with your real pages. If Tailwind mysteriously misbehaves, blame the scrollbar and then fix it.
